// Why Typescript is Statically Typed programing languate 

// Why JavaScript is Dynamically Typed Programming language

let number = 35;
console.log(typeof(age));
// Here the 'typeof' method will print the data type of the variable.

number = "Thirty Five";
console.log(typeof(age));

/* 
in Javascript after defining a variable with one specific data type , we can re initialise 
the same variable with another data type , this type of nature is know as 
Dynamically Typed programing.
 */

/* 
But in typeScript if we define a variable with one data type it can not allow to re define 
it with another data type it will thought compile time error. this type of programing is known as statically typed programing language
